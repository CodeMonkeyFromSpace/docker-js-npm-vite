/**
# Problem Statement
You're given a directed graph with N nodes (labeled from 0 to N - 1) and M edges. 
Each edge is represented as a triplet [from, to, weight], where:
- from and to are integers indicating the source and destination nodes, and
- weight is an integer cost, which may be negative, zero, or positive.
The graph does not contain negative weight cycles.
Write a function that computes the minimum total cost to travel from a given start node to a given end node. 
If no path exists between start and end, return null.
 */

 * @returns {number | null} - Minimum cost from start to end, or null if no path exists
